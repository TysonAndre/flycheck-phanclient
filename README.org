#+TITLE: Phan client for Emacs

* Description

  This package adds support of [[https://github.com/etsy/phan][phan]], the PHP static analyzer, to Emacs (as a flycheck plugin).
  The main feature is quick analysis of individual php files in a project, with the assistance of a background phan daemon.

  This is an early version with very few features.

  This is based on https://github.com/stevenremot/emacs-phan

* Installation

  Clone this repository to your computer. Then, load it in your Emacs configuration :

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/to/flycheck-phanclient")
    (require 'flycheck-phanclient)
  #+END_SRC

* Usage

** Flycheck checker

   First, load the flycheck checker:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'flycheck-phanclient)
   #+END_SRC
   
   Then, start the daemon in the folder to analyze, with the default port of 8486 (see https://github.com/etsy/phan/pull/563)

   TODO: add a way to configure individual project settings
   (e.g. ~.dir-locals.el~)

   This should be enough to have the flycheck checker run on your project.
   This will run while the project is being edited, even without saving the file.

   Note: The request frequency may still need to be tuned for larger projects.

* Configuration

   You need to install phan manually, and use a git branch with the phan daemon installed.
   Ensure that the PHP program ~phan_client~ is in your path, or copied to a folder in your $PATH.

   Currently, the phan daemon must be started manually on the directory
   (must have ~.phan/config.php~ somewhere in the folder or parent folders).
   No warning/notice is currently emitted if the daemon is not running.

   Type ~M-x customize-group RET phanclient RET~ to see the other customization options.
   More customization options will be added in the future.

* Requirements

  - PHP 7.1 with the [[https://github.com/nikic/php-ast][php-ast extension]] installed
    (daemon is not backported to PHP 7.0)
  - A php project with ~.phan/config.php` set up. See [[https://github.com/etsy/phan#getting-started][Phan - Getting Started]]
  - A phan daemon running in that project folder.
  - A phan installation including [[https://github.com/etsy/phan/pull/563][support for the phan daemon mode]]
